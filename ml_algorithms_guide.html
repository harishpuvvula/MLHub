            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> SVM finds the widest possible "safety zone" (margin) between different groups in your data. It's like drawing the most fair boundary line that gives maximum breathing room to both sides.
            </div>
            
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>🏘️ Neighborhood Boundary Planning:</strong> You're a city planner deciding where to put a fence between two different neighborhoods. Instead of just drawing any line, you want the fairest boundary that gives both sides maximum space. You find the line that's as far as possible from the closest houses on both sides - that's your "maximum margin." Even if one neighborhood has 1000 houses and another has 100, you focus on the boundary houses that matter most.

            <div class="use-cases">

            <div class="pm-insight">

            <h2>🎯 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> XGBoost builds decision trees sequentially, where each new tree specifically focuses on correcting the mistakes of all previous trees. It's Random Forest's smarter, more focused cousin.

            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>🎓 Study Group Evolution:</strong> Imagine a study group preparing for an exam. Student 1 takes the practice test and gets some questions wrong. Student 2 studies those specific mistakes and takes the test, focusing extra hard on the areas Student 1 struggled with. Student 3 then focuses on what both previous students missed. The final answer combines all their knowledge, with each student's contribution weighted by their expertise areas.

        <div class="algorithm">
            <h2>🎪 K-Means Clustering</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> K-Means groups data into clusters by finding natural "centers" and assigning each point to its closest center. You decide how many groups (K) you want beforehand.
            </div>
            
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>🛒 Mall Food Court Setup:</strong> You're designing a mall food court and want to place 3 seating areas optimally. You look at where people naturally gather, place the first table in the center of one crowd, the second in another cluster, and the third in the remaining group. Then you adjust the table positions until each is perfectly centered among its "regular customers." People naturally sit at their closest table.

            <div class="pm-insight">
                <strong>PM Insight:</strong> Perfect for discovering hidden customer segments. Easy to explain to stakeholders ("we found 4 distinct user types"). Requires business intuition to choose the right number of clusters.

        </div>

        <div class="algorithm">
            <h2>📊 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> PCA reduces the number of variables in your data while keeping the most important information. It finds the "best angles" to view your data that capture maximum variation.
            </div>
            
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>📸 Photography Portfolio:</strong> You have 1000 photos from a vacation but can only show 10 in your portfolio. Instead of randomly picking, you choose photos that capture the most unique and important moments - the sunset (represents color variation), the action shot (represents movement), the group photo (represents people). Each chosen photo represents multiple aspects of your trip while eliminating redundancy.

            <h2>🌊 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> LSTM is a special type of neural network that can remember important information over long sequences while forgetting irrelevant details. Perfect for data with time dependencies.
            </div>
            
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>📚 Reading a Mystery Novel:</strong> As you read, you remember crucial clues from chapter 2 that become important in chapter 15, but you forget minor details like what the detective had for breakfast. Your brain has "gates" that decide what's worth remembering long-term vs. what to forget. LSTM works the same way - it has forget gates, input gates, and output gates that manage memory strategically.

            <h2>🌳 Decision Trees</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <strong>The Concept:</strong> Decision Trees make predictions by asking a series of yes/no questions in a tree-like structure. Each question splits the data based on the most informative feature.

            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>🩺 Doctor's Diagnosis Process:</strong> A doctor diagnosing illness asks strategic questions: "Do you have a fever?" If yes, "Is it above 102°F?" If yes, "Do you have a sore throat?" Each answer leads to more specific questions until reaching a diagnosis. The doctor chooses questions that best separate different conditions, just like a decision tree splits data using the most informative features.
